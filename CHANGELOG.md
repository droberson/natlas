## Unreleased

## [v0.6.4]
More information can be found at [natlas/v0.6.4](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/releases/tag/v0.6.4)

### Added
* Server - Random button gives us a random host
* Server - User profiles can now select between different view formats (Currently supported: Pretty and Raw)
* Server - Added `tags` example to search help modal

### Changed
* Server - Automatically attempt to reconnect to elasticsearch on the next request if our last attempt failed and it's been more than 60 seconds.
* Server/Agent - `scan_id` field increased from 10 characters in length to 16 characters.

### Fixed
* Server - Fixed bug in scan manager ([#150](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/150)) where updating the networks in range to scan caused unexpected scan targets.
* Server - Fixed view issue not populating user's settings in profile page
* Server - Cleanup relationship between a scope item and tags when a scope item is deleted
* Agent - Fixed retry failures when server is down so agents should now automatically try to reconnect as intended

## [v0.6.3]
More information can be found at [natlas/v0.6.3](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/releases/tag/v0.6.3)

### Added
* Normal users can now be added with the add-admin.py bootstrap script

### Changed
* SECURITY - Invite and Password Reset tokens have moved from using JWT to database-backed stateful tokens. These tokens expire after a defined period of time, as well as if the token is successfully used.
* Various styling improvements for authentication pages

### Fixed
* SECURITY - Invite and Password Reset flows have been updated to include an intermediary step that prevents the secret tokens from leaking to 3rd parties via the Referer header.
* SECURITY - Email validation is much stricter now, through the use of python-email-validator. This fixes problems where emails like `test@test.com@test.com` or `test @test.com` could have been treated as valid emails, causing unexpected behaviors.
* New users are explicitly created with "is_admin" set to false, instead of the previous "None" that they would get in certain flows.
* The nginx deployment script now correctly recommends placing all logs in the same folder, instead of `/var/log/nginx/natlas` and `/var/log/nginx/natlas.io`.
* Fixed erroneous help string in search help modal that was a holdover from v0.5.x.

### Removed
* Removed an unused css load from adobe for the NATLAS logo font. We previously settled on using the image, but had forgotten to remove the font stylesheet include.

## [v0.6.2]
More information can be found at [natlas/v0.6.2](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/releases/tag/v0.6.2)

### Added
* Branding improvements
* Version is now visible in the server footer
* Back-to-top button
* Server doesn't interact with mismatched versions

### Changed
* Style improvements
* Communication between agent and server has been more standardized around json messaging

### Fixed

## [v0.6.1] - Bugfixes
More information can be found at [natlas/v0.6.1](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/releases/tag/v0.6.1)

### Fixed
* /api/natlas-services no longer breaks the admin page
* Extraneous debugging print statements removed


## [v0.6.0] - Structured data, better config, agent authn
More information can be found at [natlas/v0.6.0](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/releases/tag/v0.6.0)

### Added
* Server/Agent authentication using agent ID and secret
* Servers can assign tags to scope ranges
* Logged in users can request hosts to be rescanned, which puts them in a priority work queue
* XML parsing of nmap data to provide some structured elasticsearch data
* JSON export for scan results
* Agents can optionally ignore SSL validation warnings
* Agents can give themselves a maximum retry target before giving up a submit call to the server

### Changed
* jQuery and Bootstrap have been significantly upgraded to more modern versions
* Server setup script generates new random secret key if one doesn't already exist
* Move away from raw data view and into using the structured data
* Agents now report back to the server regardless if the host is up or not, which allows us to better track how many times we're actually scanning hosts.
* Tabled data now appears in DataTables, which allow for sorting, searching, and pagination

### Fixed
* Agents properly clean up scan data that were inadvertently left around when scans timeout
* Agents no longer request extra work for their local queue, resulting in extra data loss when agents are stopped
* Tons of HTML errors were corrected
